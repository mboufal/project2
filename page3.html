		<h3>#10</h3>
          <p>Which come first: <em>chicken</em> or <em>egg</em> ? </p>
		  <p>Although the question is typically used metaphorically, evolutionary biology provides literal answers,</p>
		  <p>made possible by the Darwinian principle that species evolve over time,</p>
		  <p>and thus that chickens had ancestors that were not chickens,</p>
		  <p>similar to a view expressed by the Greek philosopher Anaximander when addressing the paradox.</p>
